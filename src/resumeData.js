I love coding because solving problems, creating dynamic programs and seeing ideas come to life are what drive me to learn more and more every day. I particularly enjoy GUIs, data science, object-oriented programming, and full stack web development. When I\'m not coding, I enjoy playing video games, reading, watching Netflix, running, playing the piano, and playing basketball. I am a driven individual with a lifelong goal to learn as much as possible about all my passions.",
